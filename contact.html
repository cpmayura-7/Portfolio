                    It employs Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology for making toll payments directly from the prepaid or
                    savings account linked to it or directly toll owner. It is affixed on the windscreen of the vehicle and enables to drive through toll plazas without stopping for transactions.</th>

                    Nano-satellite applications.This involves the design of active inductor which uses feedback resistance to improve 
                    the equivalent inductance and the quality factor. The novelty of this work lies on the use of a few number of 
                    multi-finger transistors, which allows reducing strongly the power consumption and the silicon area. </th>

                     After a certain number of incorrect guesses, the game ends and the player loses. The game also ends if the player correctly identifies all the letters of the missing word.</th>
